=======

- ranksv

0.7.1.0
=======

- buildVector/buildMatrix

- removed NFData instances

0.6.0.0
=======

- added randomVector, gaussianSample, uniformSample, meanCov

- added rankSVD, nullspaceSVD

- rank, nullspacePrec, and economy svd defined in terms of ranksvd.

- economy svd now admits zero rank matrices and return a "degenerate
  rank 1" decomposition with zero singular value.

- added NFData instances for Matrix and Vector.

- liftVector, liftVector2 replaced by mapVector, zipVector.
