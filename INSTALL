-----------------------------------------
 A simple scientific library for Haskell
-----------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

Recommended method:
    $ sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev refblas3-dev lapack3-dev atlas3-[your arch]-dev
    $ cabal install hmatrix

Detailed installation instructions:
    http://www.hmatrix.googlepages.com/installation

INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS ----------------------------------------

1) Download the developer files gsl-1.8-lib.zip from
   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm
   and copy the gsl headers folder (under include) to:
       C:\ghc\ghc.6.x.1\include
   These headers are also available from:
       http://perception.inf.um.es/~aruiz/darcs/hmatrix/gsl.zip

2) Copy libgsl.dll, libcblas.dll (from the binaries package gsl-1.8.bin.zip)
   and liblapack.dll (borrowed from the R system) to the ghc folder, e.g.:
       C:\ghc\ghc-6.x.x.
   Rename libcblas.dll to libblas.dll.
   They are needed to compile programs.
   These three dlls are available from:
       http://perception.inf.um.es/~aruiz/darcs/hmatrix/dll1.zip

2.5) Remove the following functions from the export list of
     lib/Numeric/GSL/Special/Ellint.hs:
     ellint_Pcomp_e, ellint_Pcomp, ellint_Dcomp_e, ellint_Dcomp

3) Install the package as usual:
       runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
       runhaskell Setup.lhs build
       runhaskell Setup.lhs install

3.5) If configure cannot find ld please see:
       http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/32025

4) Copy the dlls available from:
       http://perception.inf.um.es/~aruiz/darcs/hmatrix/dll2.zip
   to the working directory or C:\windows\system
   They are required to run the programs and ghci.

5) run the tests

Unfortunately the lapack dll supplied by the R system does not include
zgels_, zgelss_, and zgees_, so the functions depending on them
(linearSolveLS, linearSolveSVD, and schur for complex data)
will produce a "non supported in this OS" runtime error.

If you find an alternative free and complete lapack.dll which works well
for this system please let me know.

The examples using graphics do not yet work in windows.
