 A simple scientific library for Haskell
-----------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

Recommended method (ok in Ubuntu/Debian systems):
    $ sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev liblapack-dev
    $ cabal install hmatrix

Detailed installation instructions:
    http://code.haskell.org/hmatrix/install.html

INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS ----------------------------------------

1) Install the Haskell Platform (tested with 2009.2.0.2).

2) Download and uncompress in a temporary location the following file:

   http://code.haskell.org/hmatrix/gsl-lapack-windows.zip

   It contains a gsl folder, and four DLL's.

3) Move the gsl folder to

   C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\2009.2.0.2\include

4) Move the four DLL's to any folder without spaces in the path, e.g.:

   C:\path\to\dll

5) Download and uncompress hmatrix-x.y.z.tar.gz from Hackage:

   http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix

6) Edit hmatrix.cabal:

     line 17:      build-type:         Custom
     change to:    build-type:         Simple

     and at the end of the file add:

        extra-libraries: libgsl-0 blas lapack
        extra-lib-dirs: C:\path\to\dll

7) Open a terminal, cd to the hmatrix folder, and run

   > cabal install

8) If everything is ok we can run the tests:

   > runhaskell examples\tests.hs

NOTE: The examples using graphics do not yet work in windows.
